The Cutter School Condo, 1 School Street, Arlington, MA was built in 1925 as the Cutter School. This elegant brick building was converted to condominiums in 1982 and consists of 35 one bedroom and two bedroom units. Many units feature dramatic and soaring ceilings, exposed brick and wood beams on walls and ceilings and oversized living areas. (courtesy of [cuttercondo.com](https://cuttercondo.com/))

The adjacent park and playground was split off from the condominiums and re-deeded to the town. Since then it this open space has contributed to many children, families, dogs and wildlife to enjoy.

The most recent play structure was built in 2000 and dedicated in 2001 to memorialize [Nicole Reinhart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicole_Reinhart) after her tragic death in a cycling race held in Arlington.

### The current closure of the play structure

As of September 2025, the play structure has been deemed unsafe and has been closed off. Due to funding deadlines and fiscal year cycles, replacement is not likely for 3 years. The Friends of Cutter / Reinhart community is strongly encouraging the town to consider a repair option to bridge the gap before replacement can be fully funded.
