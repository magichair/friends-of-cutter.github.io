It's been amazing to see how much the community cares about this little corner of Arlington! The petition now has 190+ signatures of residents of Arlington and even from neighboring towns.

You may have also seen our sign up to join the Friends of Cutter / Reinhart Park.

## The Sept 30th Parks and Rec Commission Meeting

At the Septemter 30th meeting, several of the community members were present to listen and speak about the importance of the Cutter / Reinhart playground. Leading up to this meeting, community member Alex was able to get in touch with the original manufacture of the playground. The Town and the manufacturer have shared notes and communicated. Even after viewing detailed photos and the prior inspection report, the manufacturer believes that the damage *is* repairable. The Town however must confer with Town Counsel to determine legal liability given that our CPSI (Certified Playground Safety Inspector) has declared it un-repairable.

So, the discussion has been tabled for the time being until the Commission gets an answer on liability. After that, we heard a preview of what other bureaucracy is ahead of us in the process for funding, putting out to bid, updating to other codes and other hurdles on the path to an open and safe play structure.

## What can I do to help?

We're going to keep attending Parks and Recreation Commission meetings and encouraging the Commission take action.
